# A Thorough Analysis of RL models plus Self-Attention DQN based on Atari’s Space Invader

Outer space is a place full of mystery and romance. Many people are attracted to the exploration of space. Inspired by SpaceX and NASA’s successful astronaut launch recently, we would like to do a space game that can help craft automatically explore space with its own artificial life. In our project, we will adopt the classic Atari game space invader, where players use a craft to explore the space and defeat enemies in the space. In this project, we proposed a new DQN architecture called Self-Attention DQN that combine the Self-Attention techniques with current DQN model. We also analyze Self-Attention DQN and compare it with DQN, double DQN, and dueling DQN.
